         	<p>So my current take on the state of IoT home automation is if you are already deeply invested in Apple products and invest in a HomeKit compatible mesh WiFi, accessories are relatively inexpensive. Assuming a trust level with Apple you get IMO a high level of security built in.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://bytesof.michaelbishop.me/2021/09/08/why-i-would.html">Why I would like to serve on the East Tampa CRA Citizens Advisory Council</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://bytesof.michaelbishop.me/2021/09/08/why-i-would.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-09-08 13:57:58 -0400">Sep 8, 2021</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>(<em>These are my prepared remarks edited with footnotes of ad libbed changes.</em>)</p>

<p>Good evening. My name is Michael Bishop. I am proud Tampa native residing for over 20 years in what I prefer to call the Giddens Park area with my partner and our three rescued pets. The two cats &amp; dog actually own the place, we just have a lifetime lease <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. If only they would also take care of the maintenance on a home nearing 100.</p>

<p>First I&rsquo;d like to thank everyone here tonight for your service to our community. I look forward to meeting everyone regardless of whether I am selected for the advisory committee.</p>

<p>My advocacy for my neighbors didn&rsquo;t start here nor will it end here . And when I say neighbors, I mean the folks that celebrate birthdays on Saturday or play basketball Sunday mornings at my beloved Giddens Park as much as I do my next door neighbor. I also mean the folks that have lost their way and are living along Nebraska Ave from the I-4 overpass beyond the CRA.</p>

<p>So why do I want to be on the CAC? Because I believe I can bring experience, drive and humility to support the critical role this committee plays.</p>

<p>The key lesson in civic technology is there is no tech bro saves the day story line. Technology rarely matters. It&rsquo;s often the easiest part. Where it breaks down is translating how policy is implemented in the technology. Needless red tape becomes a non-starter for folks on spotty wifi or phone with a cracked screen. If everyone isn&rsquo;t included in the process it will glaringly show up in the result.</p>

<p>One of the most profound experiences of my life was attending a full day diversity and inclusion training led by Lauraellen McCann through my volunteer work with Code for Tampa Bay. What I took away most from that training was to fully understand the immense level of privilege I was born with. Able bodied, straight CIS white man. If my father had been CEO at the phosphate plant instead of a laborer along with a lot of folks from this neighborhood, I really would have won the golden ticket. But even then, I understand there are two different kinds of poor.</p>

<p>So I was challenged to use my privilege to model behavior and stand up to those that abuse theirs. I don&rsquo;t always get it right but I am always guided by honesty, empathy and ethics.</p>

<p>Of the many lessons I took away from that day another was to go to where the work is being done. Which meant turning all of my attention back on the city. January of this year I began watching every council &amp; CRA board meeting. It didn&rsquo;t take me long to see how the two cookie jars work.</p>

<p>So while I have not had the honor to meet the folks currently on the committee putting in the work, it would be my honor to support the ongoing efforts of the committee.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>3 minutes isn’t a lot of time, so if anyone has a question for me I’d like to make myself available this evening or via phone or email.</p>

<p>Finally, I&rsquo;d like to share that as a kid growing up playing baseball  in Tampa, Belmont Heights will always hold a special place for me. Playing against Derek Bell in senior league was a special experience.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>
